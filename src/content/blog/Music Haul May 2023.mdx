## [Radiohead: In Rainbows](#radiohead-in-rainbows)

My first and favorite Radiohead album. I've only ever streamed the album until this year. Initially bought the CD this year but traded in some old CDs at my local record store to get the vinyl release. Love having this out on display and it's an amazing pressing - sounds incredible.

Wu-Tang accapellas on Beatles samples by [Tom Caruana Remix Projects (bandcamp)](https://tomcaruanamashups.bandcamp.com/music) in the UK.
Originally released in 2011 but only recently found out about this remix album.

## [Macroblank: Tales of the Cypher](#macroblank-tales-of-the-cypher)

Originally got this digitally on [bandcamp](https://macroblank.bandcamp.com/album/tales-of-the-cypher). Great music to have on in the background while I'm working. I love all the album artwork from Macroblank so it felt good about picking up at least one record to physically own.

Later jumped on the preorder for this album on  
[Aloe City World](https://www.aloecitywrld.com/). The back of the album cover was a surprise, I found it to be nicer to look at so I usually keep the back revealed when I have this out on display.
