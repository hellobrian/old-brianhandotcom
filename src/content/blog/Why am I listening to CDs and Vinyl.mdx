title: Why am I listening to CDs and Vinyl?
description: Somehow, streaming all the music ever invented was just too much of a good thing for me. I had a lot to say about how my music habits shifted in 2023 and here is a shotgun scatterbrained wall of text and photos to help explain my process and thoughts on listening to tunes.

## [Relying less on streaming music](#relying-less-on-streaming-music)

I'm relying less on streaming as my only music listening method. Trying to be more intentional with what I stream and why:

- **Previewing albums before I buy them**.

  I'm buying more albums these days and previewing entire albums before purchasing has been a huge step up from the days when I could only preview 15-30 seconds of each track on iTunes.

- **Listening to singles or a small group of tracks.**

  A lot of times, I only want to like a few songs on an album. Nuff said.

- **Some music is only available online.**

  There's a handful of music out there that never got a physical release. I have a ton of music that I love that I can only find on YouTube so I gotta keep streaming for these songs.

Normally, I wouldn't be bothering with physical music formats and FLAC files. Yes, CDs and FLAC sounds better to me, but I think streaming sounds good enough.

I blame my car (and myself obviously).

For whatever reason, listening to music through Android Auto causes all my songs to skip occasionally - even downloaded music. Super annoying! My only other option is to put music on a USB stick.

So now I'm diving back into CDs.

## [Shopping for new and used CDs](#shopping-for-new-and-used-cds)

I've been getting a lot of good stuff at Half Price Books and occasionally buying new CDs from Barnes and Nobles.

There are a variety of things I'm not worrying about as much when I'm shopping for CDs.

- **Price**

  I've seen prices for used CDs in the $7 to $15 price range. I think this is reasonable. New CDs are probably $15 or more. But, if it turns out I don't want to keep those CDs in my physical collection, I can almost always resell those CDs and get some money back since I always have a back-up on my computer. It never feels like I'm losing the music when I'm reselling the physical CDs.

- **Resiliency**

  The CD format is pretty resilient. I don't have to scrutinize too much on whether a used CD is in perfect condition. It can still have light scratches and I'll feel pretty confident it'll work just fine. And they're going to travel so much better which is great for when I'm shopping on a trip or buying CDs online; I have high confidence that I can travel or ship CDs without it getting damaged.

- **Ease of playback**

  I bought some actual CD players ([more on those here](#cd-players)), and when I don't feel like fussing with a vinyl record (more on that later too), it's quite easy to plop a CD into a tray and press play. I don't have to be super precious with it and I love that.

## [CD players](#cd-players)

import cdPlayer from "/images/blog/vinyl-sucks/cd-player.webp";

I cycled through a couple of lackluster CD players; [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0742RKNKP) in particular didn't have gapless playback so it was a dealbreaker for me. I finally settled on these two players.

[**Onkyo C-7030**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UR487A)

This is part of my [main listening setup in my living room](#my-living-room-setup). I've also got this hooked up to a [Schitt Modi 3+ DAC](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NXST147).
Before, I was using a [sony dvd player](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-dvd-player-black/4790684.p?skuId=4790684) for playing CDs, it sounded great and way more affordable than the Onkyo C-7030, but the buttons on the sony and the remote were driving me kind of crazy. They were mushy to press and it took a few presses to actually trigger the action you wanted.

[**Sharp - 5-Disc Micro System (XL-BH250)**](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sharp-5-disc-micro-system-black/5937003.p?skuId=5937003)

I keep this in my office upstairs. Originally, this was the system I kept in my living room but I couldn't figure out how to connect this to the reciever I have. But, this has been a better fit for my office since I tend to use this more for music that is better suited for me to do work: lofi hip-hop, vaporwave and futurefunk music.

## [Ripping and Burning CDs](#ripping-and-burning-cds)

The last time I ripped and burned CDs was back in high school and college: The iPod days (and a few days of CD and MiniDisc walkman devices).

But now in 2023, storage space is cheaper and more abundant compared to 10+ years ago.

1. I opted to manage my music with [MediaMonkey on my Windows PC](https://www.mediamonkey.com/windows) instead of iTunes (Apply Music).
2. Ripping CDs into FLAC files has been great. I started with a [cheap external optical drive](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C1VP88H). It was bad: it couldn't handle reading CDs with minor scratches and there were a few times where it scratched some of my CDs. Now, I'm using an [internal optical drive from Asus](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056UV96I) and an [enclosure kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XRCCV44) to use it externally via USB. It works faster and has been able to read and write CDs perfectly.
3. Later started burning digital albums to CDs. A lot of these albums were from Bandcamp and were only available digitally or had vinyl offerings but were too expensive or sold out.

If I were more practical, CDs and streaming would be all I need.

## [But, vinyl...I couldn't resist](#but-vinyli-couldnt-resist)

It's the album art. I love album art.

Dipping my toes back into the physical realm of music listening got me curious about vinyl and now I'm also collecting records.

I firmly believe CDs are a better format for music compared to vinyl. I have no nostaligia for vinyl, I grew up with CDs, and I'm not sure if I'm sensitive enough to really hear the "warmth" or "richness" of analog when compared to CDs.

What got to me was the album art.

Vinyl records are undeinably more beautiful because the album art is bigger and it isn't covered by a glossy plastic jewel case. That's my only reason for wanting to dive into vinyl...and honestly, sometimes albums only get vinyl releases so if I want a physical copy of an album, I will get the vinyl record.

With that said, I find that I have to be more thoughtful about buying records.

## [Vinyl is fussy](#vinyl-is-fussy)

Fussy, expensive and fragile.

I've already had my fair share of records with issues that I couldn't return:

- Warping (very expensive and time consuming to fix)
- Persistent static (haven't tried to fix)
- Audible skips and pops (Unfixable in my experience so far)

Nothing new, I'm sure.

I suppose I'm getting more acclimated to the ritual of slowing down for the music I want to listen to. But as long as I'm not clumsy with my records (I am), then it's a really enjoyable experience for me to put a record on, look at the art and just be present for that session.

## [My rules for buying records](#my-rules-for-buying-records)

✅ Must love all the songs.

✅ No live albums.

✅ 1 LP per album.

✅ Album art must be display worthy

✅ Must be a 12” LP

[**Audio-Technica AT-LP60X turntable**](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-At-LP60X-GM-Belt-Drive-Hi-Fidelity-Anti-Resonance/dp/B07N3X7KPX)

I figured I would buy a turntable that's more beginner friendly and not too expensive in case vinyl ended up being something I wasn't interested in pursuing. The LP-60 seemed to be one of the most recommended turntables. I really appreciate the auto-start and stop features since I'm not really experienced with handling the tone arm. And most of the time I'm usually doing something while listening to records so when my hands are full, it's nice that the record can stop playing for me.

[**The Turntable Station from WickerWoodWorks**](https://wickerwoodworks.com/collections/frontpage/products/the-turntable-station)

- Legs: 6" Hairpin Legs

Once I felt more sure that my record collection would be a more permanent fixture, I decided I would invest in a proper turntable station. I had my eye on WickerWoodWorks for a while and super happy with the turntable station I got. In retrospect, I may have been just as happy with a more affordable option for stacking all my audio gear but I really liked the front-facing record storage. Although all my records are on a different shelf at the moment, I loved the idea of browsing through my records with their covers forward, just like a record store.

**Old receiver and speakers**

The biggest part of this setup has to be the old reciever and speakers. It was my Dad's old equipment that he got back in the 90s. Everything sounds amazing coming through the speakers. Definitely not an audiophile. It's my first time having giant floor speakers in a house where I can enjoy them as loud as I want.
