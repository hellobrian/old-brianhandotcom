## Getting into vinyl for the first time

I never collected records before and never had interest in vinyl until this year. What happened? Honestly, I think it's the album art.

I remember walking into a Barnes & Nobles to get the new Paramore CD and I noticed all the records that were on display and I thought, "Wow these look good."

It's kind of silly, these were all fairly mainstream albums that I had seen online but something about seeing the tangible art on a canvas larger than a CD made me go "I would keep that on display in my house".

But man, vinyl is expensive. I totally appreciate that it costs as much as it does but I just know that I can't casually be buying records every day.

## My rules for buying records

Most people would agree that vinyl is not a practical medium for listening to music. They're fragile, and they're expensive compared to CDs and even more so when compared to streaming the same music online. I found myself relying on a few rules when considering a new record purchase.

1. I have to like all the songs. No skips.
2. The album should be 1 LP. I personally don't love handling more than one LP per album.
3. Album art has to be something I want to display.
4. It's gotta be a 12" LP

## Records I bought that break the rules

There have definitely been exceptions that I made with my record purchases.

As far as I know, [21st Century - Ahead of our time](https://www.discogs.com/release/1165256-21st-Century-Ahead-Of-Our-Time), only ever released on vinyl and I mainly wanted it for one song, "Remember the rain".

Same thing happened with [The Sylvers - Something Special](https://www.discogs.com/release/552762-The-Sylvers-Something-Special), only on vinyl and I just wanted one song, "Hot Line"
