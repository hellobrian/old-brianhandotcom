## Vanguard65

- Ordered: 06/01/2023
- ETA: Q4 2023

A 65% keyboard from Keebfront. It allows for a plateless hotswap configuration, which is pretty excited for me. 
This will also be my first keyboard with a slider and a rotary encoder. 
Not quite sure what I'll do with the slider yet. Oh yeah, and it's green! This will be my 2nd green keyboard. 

## Wind X R2

- Ordered: 03/01/2023
- ETA: Q3 2023

This will be a unique layout for my keyboard collection - FRL (f-row-less) keyboard with a full numpad, and it's not using a 1u zero, it's using the big 0 like a fullsize keyboard.
It's also orange and bluetooth! I'm leaning towards using this mainly with my mac since it'll tidy things up for me there. 

## The Beaches - Blame My Ex (LP + CD)

- Ordered: 05/22/2023
- ETA: 09/15/2023

Stumbled on this band recently and I've had all their new singles on constant rotation. 
Really psyched that they're releasing a new album independently. 
Normally, I would want to preview the whole album before buying but I really enjoyed the new music they released and figured I'd take a chance and preorder the CD and LP.


## Neoncity Records

- Ordered: 03/25/2023
- ETA: 03/2023

This was a really impulsive purchase. Ordered 3 LPs from Neoncity Records:

- Macross 82-99 - 'Sailorwave' (Picture Disc Vinyl)
- Luanmer - 'Evening'
- Strawberry Station - 'Talk of the Dancefloor'

Three really great futurefunk albums I've been enjoying for the last few months. But as I'm writing this now in June...a little worried about if/when this order arrives. 

## Retrofuture by Sweeps

- Ordered: 03/19/2023
- ETA: ???

Lo-Fi Hip-Hop album that was crowdfunded on Qrates. 
Crowdfunding was successful but no word yet on shipping dates.

## Flamingo Funk vol.3 by My Pet Flamingo

- Ordered: 03/20/2023
- ETA: 08/07/2023

Vaporwave and Future Funk compilation album.
